## What I Learned
How to use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and content of the website based on the device being used. By using responsive design techniques, I was able to create a website that looks great on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

## Optimizations
I'd like to compress the images to optimize page load times and ensure that the website loads quickly and efficiently for users on all devices.
